<P><Strong>MyDailog</Strong>与其他对话框控件不同，<Strong>MyDailog</Strong>会在Vue的根实例插入一个<Strong>MyDialogList</Strong>节点，所有的对话框都会放入这个节点中。在使用<A href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools\">vue-devtools</A>调试时候，可以在这里找到正在开发中的对话框控件。</P>\r\n        <Img src=\"../assert/dev.png\" />\r\n\r\n        <Alert>\r\n            当出现多个Vue的根实例的时候，每一个配置了myDialog的Vue的根实例，都会插入一个<Strong>MyDialogList</Strong>。彼此之间是不会冲突的。\r\n        </Alert>\r\n\r\n        <Alert>据说<Strong>Vue3</Strong>支持Fragment（多个根节点）和Protal（在dom其他部分渲染组建内容）组件等功能，未来<Strong>MyDailog</Strong>根据这些特性进一步优化调试体验。\r\n        </Alert>\r\n\r\n        <H3>热更新</H3>\r\n        <P><Strong>MyDailog</Strong>是编程式对话框，有副作用，因此对热更并不是特别友好，但是只要基于几个原则，降低开发的副作用，仍然是支持热更新。具体原则如下：</P>\r\n        <Li>尽量使用vue的SFC控件定义对话框内容</Li>\r\n        <Li>不要在vue的生命周期钩子中打开对话框</Li>\r\n        <P>同时要注意的是，<Strong>热更新仅限于内容控件</Strong>，如果需要修改打开过程中的状态，需要关闭对话框再重新打开，或者刷新页面。</P>\r\n        <Code :code=\"hotUpdate\" lang=\"html\"></Code>\r\n\r\n        <H2>与vuex和vue-router集成</H2>\r\n        <P>很多对话框控件是无法访问到vuex和vue-router的属性，这是因为他们是用一个新的Vue实例去打开对话框，而新的Vue实例中，是访问不到当前Vue实例的vuex、vue-i18n、vue-router等属性。<Strong>MyDailog</Strong>与他们不同，我们将对话框插入到当前实例中，因此和一个普通的控件没有任何区别，因此可以访问如vuex、vue-i18n、vue-router等属性。</P>\r\n        <Demo title=\"与vuex集成\" :demo=\"vuex\" :code=\"vuexCode\" lang=\"javascript\">\r\n        </Demo>\r\n\r\n        <H3>原理</H3>\r\n        <P>打开对话框时，常见的做法是new一个新的Vue实例，如：</P>\r\n        <Code :code=\"core\"></Code>\r\n        <P>而<Strong>MyDialog</Strong>是将当前的Vue实例，作为parent传递给了新创建的Vue对话框实例，如：</P>\r\n        <Code :code=\"core2\"></Code>\r\n\r\n        <H2>单独引用</H2>\r\n        <P><Strong>MyDialog</Strong>为<Strong>Vue.prototype</Strong>添加了全局方法<Strong>$MyDailog</Strong>。但是如果在Vue实例外想使用<Strong>MyDialog</Strong>，可以使用单独引入的方法。</P>\r\n        <Code :code=\"\r\n`import MyDialogPlugin from 'my-vue-dialog'\r\nlet MyDialog = MyDialogPlugin.getInstance()\r\nMyDialog.open(...)\r\n`\"></Code>\r\n        <P>该方法一定要在存在使用了<Strong>MyDialog</Strong>的Vue实例存在的情况下才能返回有效的MyDialog实例。如下例：</P>\r\n        <Code :code=\"\r\n`import Vue from 'vue'\r\nimport MyDialogPlugin from 'my-vue-dialog'\r\nimport 'my-vue-dialog/dist/my-vue-dialog.css'\r\n\r\nvue.use(MyDialogPlugin)\r\n\r\n// 因为没有初始化了MyDialog的Vue实例，所以MyDialog1是null\r\nlet MyDialog1 = MyDialog.getInstance()\r\n\r\nlet vueInstance1 = new Vue({\r\n    el: ...,\r\n    template: '...',\r\n})\r\n// 因为vueInstance1没有初始化了MyDialog，所以MyDialog2也是null\r\nlet MyDialog2 = MyDialog.getInstance()\r\n\r\nlet vueInstance2 = new Vue({\r\n    el: ...,\r\n    template: '...',\r\n    // 使用myDialog属性，声明使用控\r\n    myDialog: {}\r\n})\r\n// 因为vueInstance2已经初始化了MyDialog，所以MyDialog3不是null，MyDialog3创建的对话框都会挂载在vueInstance2下面\r\nlet MyDialog3 = MyDialog.getInstance()`\"></Code>\r\n        <H3>处理多实例情况</H3>\r\n        <P>默认情况下MyDialog.getInstance只会返回最新创建的Vue实例下的MyDialog实例，如果有多个Vue实例，想分别单独引入自己的MyDialog实例，可以在初始化MyDialog时候给其加key，如下列：</P>\r\n\r\n        <Code :code=\"\r\n`import Vue from 'vue'\r\nimport MyDialog from 'my-vue-dialog'\r\nimport 'my-vue-dialog/dist/my-vue-dialog.css'\r\n\r\nvue.use(MyDialog)\r\n\r\nlet vueInstance1 = new Vue({\r\n
